            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of local tech enthusiasts
                in a university auditorium. Its initial aim was to foster knowledge sharing
                and collaboration within the burgeoning tech community. Over the years,
                it rapidly grew in popularity, attracting speakers and attendees from
                across the nation.
            </p>
            <p>
                By 2015, TechCon had become a flagship event, moving to larger venues
                and expanding its scope to include international speakers and a wider
                array of topics, from software development to emerging hardware innovations.
                Each year, we strive to build upon our legacy of excellence and community.
